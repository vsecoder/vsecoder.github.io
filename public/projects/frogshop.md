FrogShop is an AI-powered demo store created for showcasing AI applications in e-commerce, developed specifically for a hackathon.

## About the Project

**Purpose and Goals**

The main goal of FrogShop is to demonstrate how AI can improve user experience in online retail by simplifying feedback analysis and ensuring reviews remain relevant and informative. FrogShop integrates two key AI features:

1. **AI Review Filter**  
   This feature automatically checks reviews for adequacy and relevance, helping to maintain a high-quality and trustworthy review section.

2. **"Key Summary" of Reviews**  
   The AI extracts meaningful insights from reviews, highlighting both positive and negative points using concise keywords. For example:  
   - *"Clean sound"*  
   - *"Good quality for the price"*  
   - *"Suitable for beginners"*  
   - *"Excellent microphone"*

This approach allows users to quickly grasp the product's strengths and weaknesses without reading lengthy reviews.

## How It Works

FrogShop uses **GPT-4o** with carefully crafted prompts to ensure accurate filtering and meaningful summarization of customer feedback. The AI processes large volumes of reviews, extracts key points, and eliminates irrelevant or inappropriate content to improve overall user experience.
